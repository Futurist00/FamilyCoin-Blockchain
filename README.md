# FamilyCoin-Blockchain
Spin off of the project from Udemy course I took on blockchain by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

Download to local drive and cd into the folder in your terminal and type:
python node.py -p {insert_whichever_port_num}

If you omit -p and the port number, the default will be 5000.

Now, go to localhost:PORT in your browser and it will be successfully running.
Try different PORTs for different wallets.
